				Grace, I came back to life before your eyes. I held back death. Look, I can't make your dream come true forever, but I can make it come true today. It is! It's the city of New New York! Strictly speaking, it's the fifteenth New York since the original, so that makes it New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New New York. Well, I'll tell you something that should be of vital interest to you.…That you, Sir, are a NITWIT! When I say run, run. ...RUN! Right! So stop dilly-dallying, and cross it!

				Every great decision creates ripples. Like a huge boulder dropping in a lake. The ripples merge and rebound off the banks in unforseeable ways. The heavier the decision, the larger the waves, the more uncertain the consequences. Boring. And I hate hotels. You see when I started, all those years ago, I was just running. I called myself the Doctor but it was just a name. Then I went to Skaro. And I met you lot. And I understood who I was. Eh? Doctor who? What's he talking about…? Goodbye, Clara. Right! So stop dilly-dallying, and cross it!

				A tear, Sarah Jane? No, don't cry. While there's life, there's... I love humans. Always seeing patterns in things that aren't there. You’ll never understand. I want to see the universe, not to rule it. My dear Miss Shaw, I never report myself anywhere, particularly not forthwith. Well, of course I'm being childish! There's no point being grown-up if you can't be childish sometimes. Big scarf, bow tie, big embarrassing. Shush. I'll tell you what, then: don't...step on any butterflies. What have butterflies ever done to you?

				I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Our lives are different from anybody else’s. That’s the exciting thing. Nobody in the universe can do what we’re doing. Oh, marvellous. You're going to kill me. What a finely tuned response to the situation. I don't like it. No sir. Thirteen! You may be a doctor. But I'm the Doctor. The definite article, you might say. I need...I need...I need... fish fingers and custard! So these are my replacements. A dandy and a clown. You can always judge a man by the quality of his enemies.

				Have faith, Brigadier. Have I ever led you astray? Now would you stand aside before I shoot myself? Once upon a time. The end. Dad skills. This stuff, or whoever sent it, is cleverer than we are. Unfortunate, isn't it? Oh, for God's sake! Gallfrey stands! I am the Doctor! The original, you might say! That's the trouble with regeneration. You quite never know what you're going to get. We are always in trouble! Isn't it extraordinary—it follows us everywhere. The best thing about a machine that makes sense is you can very easily make it turn out nonsense.

				Look at me. No plans, no backup, no weapons worth a damn. Oh, and something else I don't have: anything to lose. So, if you're sitting up there with your silly little spaceships and your silly little guns and you've any plans on taking the Pandorica tonight; just remember who's standing in your way. Remember every black day I ever stopped you and then, and then, do the smart thing. Let somebody else try first. I once spent a hell of a long time trying to get a gobby Australian to Heathrow airport.

				Why do you have three mirrors? Why don't you just turn your head? The past is another country. 1987's just the Isle of Wight. I am the Doctor! The original you might say! I might've been saying something important. I was saying something important! I once spent a hell of a long time trying to get a gobby Australian to Heathrow airport. Every great decision creates ripples. Like a huge boulder dropping in a lake. The ripples merge and rebound off the banks in unforseeable ways. The heavier the decision, the larger the waves, the more uncertain the consequences.

				An unintelligent enemy is far less dangerous than an intelligent one…. Life depends on change and renewal. It's rather a pity, in a way...now the universe is down to 699 wonders. We all have a universe of our own terrors to face. Oh, my giddy aunt! Reverse the polarity of the neutron flow. Usually called 'The Doctor.' Or 'The Caretaker.' Or 'Get off this planet.' Though, strictly speaking, that probably isn't a name. Look at me. No plans, no backup, no weapons worth a damn. Oh, and something else I don't have: anything to lose. So, if you're sitting up there with your silly little spaceships and your silly little guns and you've any plans on taking the Pandorica tonight; just remember who's standing in your way. Remember every black day I ever stopped you and then, and then, do the smart thing. Let somebody else try first.

				Only the madman can see the way clearly through the tangled forest. A TARDIS is my ship that carries me through Time and Space. T-A-R-D-I-S. It stands for Time And Relative Dimension In Space. Soon, I expect. Or later. One of those. Logic, my dear Zoe, merely enables one to be wrong with authority. I am totally against bantering. This stuff, or whoever sent it, is cleverer than we are. Unfortunate, isn't it? Go and be the Doctor that I could never be. Two wrongs don't make a left turn. Your hips are fine, you're built like a man!

				Courage isn’t a matter of not being frightened, it’s being afraid and doing what you have to do anyway. An unintelligent enemy is far less dangerous than an intelligent one…. It’s a bit more exciting when you go the other way. Smith. Doctor John Smith. No, not the hugging. I'm against the hugging. There's something that doesn't make sense. Let's go and poke it with a stick. You need to get yourself a better dictionary. When you do, look up 'genocide'. You'll find a little picture of me there, and the caption'll read 'Over my dead body'.

				We're fallin' through space, you and me, clinging to the skin of this tiny little world, and if we let go... I hate computers and refuse to be bullied by them. The best thing about a machine that makes sense is you can very easily make it turn out nonsense. Kidneys! I have kidneys. And I don't like the colour. It’s a bit more exciting when you go the other way. Life depends on change and renewal. There was a war. A Time War. The Last Great Time War. My people fought a race called the Daleks, for the sake of all creation. And they lost. We lost. Everyone lost. They're all gone now. My family. My friends. Even that sky.

				Yeah? Well I'm the Lord of Time. There's something that doesn't make sense. Let's go and poke it with a stick. An unintelligent enemy is far less dangerous than an intelligent one…. Adric? Come on! It was on the planet Skaro that my old enemy the Master was finally put on trial. They say he listened calmly as his list of evil crimes was read... and sentence passed. Then he made his last and I thought somewhat curious request. He demanded that I, the Doctor, a rival Timelord, should take his remains back to our home planet, Gallifrey.

				We're fallin' through space, you and me, clinging to the skin of this tiny little world, and if we let go... I hate computers and refuse to be bullied by them. The best thing about a machine that makes sense is you can very easily make it turn out nonsense. Kidneys! I have kidneys. And I don't like the colour. It’s a bit more exciting when you go the other way. Life depends on change and renewal. There was a war. A Time War. The Last Great Time War. My people fought a race called the Daleks, for the sake of all creation. And they lost. We lost. Everyone lost. They're all gone now. My family. My friends. Even that sky.

				Grace, I came back to life before your eyes. I held back death. Look, I can't make your dream come true forever, but I can make it come true today. It is! It's the city of New New York! Strictly speaking, it's the fifteenth New York since the original, so that makes it New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New New York. Well, I'll tell you something that should be of vital interest to you.…That you, Sir, are a NITWIT! When I say run, run. ...RUN! Right! So stop dilly-dallying, and cross it!

				Every great decision creates ripples. Like a huge boulder dropping in a lake. The ripples merge and rebound off the banks in unforseeable ways. The heavier the decision, the larger the waves, the more uncertain the consequences. Boring. And I hate hotels. You see when I started, all those years ago, I was just running. I called myself the Doctor but it was just a name. Then I went to Skaro. And I met you lot. And I understood who I was. Eh? Doctor who? What's he talking about…? Goodbye, Clara. Right! So stop dilly-dallying, and cross it!

				A tear, Sarah Jane? No, don't cry. While there's life, there's... I love humans. Always seeing patterns in things that aren't there. You’ll never understand. I want to see the universe, not to rule it. My dear Miss Shaw, I never report myself anywhere, particularly not forthwith. Well, of course I'm being childish! There's no point being grown-up if you can't be childish sometimes. Big scarf, bow tie, big embarrassing. Shush. I'll tell you what, then: don't...step on any butterflies. What have butterflies ever done to you?

				I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Our lives are different from anybody else’s. That’s the exciting thing. Nobody in the universe can do what we’re doing. Oh, marvellous. You're going to kill me. What a finely tuned response to the situation. I don't like it. No sir. Thirteen! You may be a doctor. But I'm the Doctor. The definite article, you might say. I need...I need...I need... fish fingers and custard! So these are my replacements. A dandy and a clown. You can always judge a man by the quality of his enemies.

				Have faith, Brigadier. Have I ever led you astray? Now would you stand aside before I shoot myself? Once upon a time. The end. Dad skills. This stuff, or whoever sent it, is cleverer than we are. Unfortunate, isn't it? Oh, for God's sake! Gallfrey stands! I am the Doctor! The original, you might say! That's the trouble with regeneration. You quite never know what you're going to get. We are always in trouble! Isn't it extraordinary—it follows us everywhere. The best thing about a machine that makes sense is you can very easily make it turn out nonsense.

				Look at me. No plans, no backup, no weapons worth a damn. Oh, and something else I don't have: anything to lose. So, if you're sitting up there with your silly little spaceships and your silly little guns and you've any plans on taking the Pandorica tonight; just remember who's standing in your way. Remember every black day I ever stopped you and then, and then, do the smart thing. Let somebody else try first. I once spent a hell of a long time trying to get a gobby Australian to Heathrow airport.

				Why do you have three mirrors? Why don't you just turn your head? The past is another country. 1987's just the Isle of Wight. I am the Doctor! The original you might say! I might've been saying something important. I was saying something important! I once spent a hell of a long time trying to get a gobby Australian to Heathrow airport. Every great decision creates ripples. Like a huge boulder dropping in a lake. The ripples merge and rebound off the banks in unforseeable ways. The heavier the decision, the larger the waves, the more uncertain the consequences.

				An unintelligent enemy is far less dangerous than an intelligent one…. Life depends on change and renewal. It's rather a pity, in a way...now the universe is down to 699 wonders. We all have a universe of our own terrors to face. Oh, my giddy aunt! Reverse the polarity of the neutron flow. Usually called 'The Doctor.' Or 'The Caretaker.' Or 'Get off this planet.' Though, strictly speaking, that probably isn't a name. Look at me. No plans, no backup, no weapons worth a damn. Oh, and something else I don't have: anything to lose. So, if you're sitting up there with your silly little spaceships and your silly little guns and you've any plans on taking the Pandorica tonight; just remember who's standing in your way. Remember every black day I ever stopped you and then, and then, do the smart thing. Let somebody else try first.

				Only the madman can see the way clearly through the tangled forest. A TARDIS is my ship that carries me through Time and Space. T-A-R-D-I-S. It stands for Time And Relative Dimension In Space. Soon, I expect. Or later. One of those. Logic, my dear Zoe, merely enables one to be wrong with authority. I am totally against bantering. This stuff, or whoever sent it, is cleverer than we are. Unfortunate, isn't it? Go and be the Doctor that I could never be. Two wrongs don't make a left turn. Your hips are fine, you're built like a man!

				Courage isn’t a matter of not being frightened, it’s being afraid and doing what you have to do anyway. An unintelligent enemy is far less dangerous than an intelligent one…. It’s a bit more exciting when you go the other way. Smith. Doctor John Smith. No, not the hugging. I'm against the hugging. There's something that doesn't make sense. Let's go and poke it with a stick. You need to get yourself a better dictionary. When you do, look up 'genocide'. You'll find a little picture of me there, and the caption'll read 'Over my dead body'.

				Yeah? Well I'm the Lord of Time. There's something that doesn't make sense. Let's go and poke it with a stick. An unintelligent enemy is far less dangerous than an intelligent one…. Adric? Come on! It was on the planet Skaro that my old enemy the Master was finally put on trial. They say he listened calmly as his list of evil crimes was read... and sentence passed. Then he made his last and I thought somewhat curious request. He demanded that I, the Doctor, a rival Timelord, should take his remains back to our home planet, Gallifrey.
